I'm familiar with adaptive web design so this is my first real foray into responsive web design. I have a loose plan for how I want my portfolio site to look and honestly its pretty ambitious. 
But hey, I don't like to set EASY goals for myself to reach or else I get bored lol. So far I got into the basics of flexbox CSS today and it all makes sense...  so far. We'll see how much more I can get done tomorrow!
